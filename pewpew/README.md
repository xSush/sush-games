**Welcome to Pew Pew**, a doutone [danmaku](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Danmaku) style game that is (almost) **completely homebrewed** in native HTML, CSS, and ES6 Javascript. Initially assigned as a homework project over my Spring Break, I tweaked it to also work as a submission for the [Kaboom Jam](https://replit.com/talk/announcements/KABOOM-JAM/127934)!

## **Story**
Pew Pew is the **tale of Rosi**, your average girl with the **power to absorb energy**! She can take energy in with her shield and **fire it back** out at her enemies the Azurites!

| Arrow Keys | Movement |
| Z | Shield |
| X | Shoot |
| Space | Start/Play Again |

You **need to absorb bullets with your shield before you can fire**, and you **can't shield when you have full ammo**!!! Remember this when playing, it can be really helpful. 

## **Features**
- Custom Graphics
- Fully Homebrewed "Game Engine"
- Small File Size (like 11kb when minified)
- Sound Effects (that work on iOS too!!!)
- Fun Levels
- Minified Code, but also Prettified and Javadoc Annotated Code for Review

## **Development**
This game was **created over the span of the KaboomJS Jam** (which coincided with my Spring Break) and during which time I tested various game engines. They worked fine, but I thought I could push myself better and stand out, so **I homebrewed the entire system**, setting up the Class managers and **creating the characters straight from scratch**. The result was more than satisfying, and really fun to play as well (thank goodness for ES6)!

## **Libraries Used**
I used the *[jsfxr](http://sfxr.me)* library for the chiptune sound effects, mostly because it was a pain to even try and integrate sound but also because this was amazing! I also used *[PixelFont](https://github.com/PaulBGD/PixelFont)* but I modified it slightly for my own use.

## **Further Development**
I could certainly add in a pause feature xD.
In all honesty, I could add in more levels, make the "AI" better.

## **Bugs**
Please report them! It really does help with the quality of the game.
